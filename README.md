This is the final project for the "Machine Learning with Python" course from Coursera, offered by IBM.
In this notebook I have used four classification algorithms: kNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
The course covers various Machine Learning algorithms for Regression, Classification, Clustering, and Recommender systems.
